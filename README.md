how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 19

## Self-Reflection:
This one was difficult for me due to me erroneously placing my webpack script file in the scripts folder and then telling it to start there. I was able to, after much hair pulling, realize my mistake and moved it into the root and the problem was resolved. Other than that, there directions were clear. My only test that failed was due to folder structure, but what it wanted I know was included, the resources folder, but didnt seem to see it.

### How long it took me to finish this?
